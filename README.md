# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).

### Goals
In this project the goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. Car's localization and sensor fusion data is provided, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Reflection

#### Model
I started with the basic model advised by Aaron Brown in the project Q&A video. The predicted trajectory waypoints `next_x_vals, next_y_vals` are generated as follows:
1. Start with previous path points `previous_path_x, previous_path_y` (lines 323-354).
2. Add 3 anchor points evenly spaced at distance = `safe_dist` m (lines 356-360).
3. Transform all these points from map coordinates to car coordinates (lines 362-369).
4. Generate a spline that fits all these points (lines 371-378).
5. Add the previous path points to the predicted trajectory (lines 381-390).
6. Add additional points along the spline to make total number of waypoints = 50 (lines 392-418). Spacing of these points is such that the car will go at desired speed (lines 403-407).
The points are transformed back to map coordinates before adding them to the predicted trajectory waypoints (lines 412-417).

#### Behavior & Path Planning
To determine whether the car should stay in the lane, or change lane left / right, slow down or speed up, the following logic is used:
1. Use Sensor Fusion data to determine location and speed of other cars around our car (lines 271-280).
2. (This is the part that is an improvement over the basic model given by Aaron.) For each other car, find if it is ahead of us in the same lane or in adjacent left or right lanes, and at an unsafe distance (lines 282-300).
3. If there is a car ahead of us at an unsafe distance, check if it's feasible and safe to change lane to the left lane (i.e. a lane in the same direction exists on the left and there is no car in that lane within an unsafe distance). If so, change lane to left. Otherwise, check if it's feasible and safe to change lane to the right. If so, change lane to right. Otherwise (if we cannot change lane), just plan to reduce speed (lines 302-320).
4. To efficiently reduce speed, increment on decrement it based on the above determination by a small amount, while calculating the future waypoints along the spline (lines 396-401).

#### Tuning parameters
I started with values of safe distance `safe_dist` = 30 m, speed increment/decrement delta value `ref_speed_delta` = 1 m/s, and max speed `speed_limit` = 24 m/s. Testing showed that it was necessary to reduce both the max speed and the speed delta value to avoid exceeding max acceleration limit and avoid going out of lane boundaries. I experimented with various values before finally settling on `safe_dist` = 32 m, `ref_speed_delta` = 0.1 m/s, and `speed_limit` = 22.1 m/s. I kept the simulator running for a long time multiple times and didn't see any incidents for 12 miles, so this model satisfies all project rubrics. 

#### Scope for improvement
This model is simple, and does not use a cost function per se. Techniques mentioned in the lessons to evaluate many different paths and choose the best one based on minimum cost can be implemented to improve the model. Also, this model is suitable for driving on the freeway only, and needs adjustments for city driving with frequent stops.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
